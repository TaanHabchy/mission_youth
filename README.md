# Final Project for Mobile App

Hello Dr. Mirabelli, 
A couple points about my app:
1. I could never figure out how to control the width of my containers in the prayers page when set in a ListView.builder, for some reason they take up the whole width.
2. I know you told me in the last project I should put the colors.dart file in the Util folder, but I could not find the folder after some search, so I figured
   it would be fine to just leave it as it is.
